This is the Java SDK for MySpaceID.  This SDK lets the developer build apps (that run outside MySpace) that authenticate the user against MySpace.  After the user has been authenticated, your site/application will be able to fetch the user's data such as name, friends, etc., from MySpace.<p/>

You have two choices for how to do the authentication:
<ul>
<li><b>OAuth</b>: use the classes documented in this Javadoc.  Refer to sample/oauth to see how this API is used.  To run this sample, please enter your own key/secret in oauth-demo.jsp.</li>
<li><b>OpenID-OAuth hybrid</b>: customize the sample in the sample/hybrid directory.  To customize, replace hybrid-login.jsp with your own page to invoke the consumer servlet, and replace return.jsp to pull user data after the user has logged on.  Note that return.jsp is specified by the "return" servlet initialization parameter in web.xml.  To get this sample to run, you will need to:
	<ul>
	<li>Enter your own key/secret in web.xml as well as return.jsp</li>
	<li>Enter your own key in web.xml</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
