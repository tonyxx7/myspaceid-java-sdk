
README -- MySpaceID
*******************

This package is the Java SDK for MySpaceID.  It allows developers to 
conveniently develop applications that run off the MySpace site and yet 
connect to a user's MySpace account.  Specifically, applications will be able 
to redirect the user to authenticate at MySpace, after which the user's 
MySpace account data become readable and writeable to the application.

Two options for authentication are available in this SDK: OAuth and OpenID.  
Specific instructions on how to achieve either are in the Javadocs in the 
doc directory.

This package is built on top of the openid4java package with minor 
modifications.  Its source code only is included here, but if you need the 
entire package, it is available at http://code.google.com/p/openid4java/.
