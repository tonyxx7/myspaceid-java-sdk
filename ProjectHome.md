Whether you are hosting an application on your own server or working with an OpenSocial app hosted by MySpace, you can use elements of this Software Development Kit (SDK) to make calls to the MySpace Application Programming Interface (API). This API provides access to a variety of MySpace features and data.

If you have registered an application hosted on your server as a MySpaceID app, this SDK  shows you how to implement the OAuth secure access protocol. The immediate benefit is that your app’s users will be able to log in to your application using their familiar MySpace account info, rather than having to set up and remember yet another username and password. The greater benefit is that your MySpaceID app can access MySpace data through the MySpace APIs.

All MySpace applications — both MySpaceID-registered apps and MySpace-hosted apps — can access MySpace data through the MySpace APIs.

Information about MySpace applications is available at the Wiki page titled [What are MySpace Applications?](http://developerwiki-stage/index.php?title=What_are_MySpace_Applications%3F).

This SDK project contains examples of the base API code necessary to make signed requests against the MySpace REST API. See the <b><a href='http://code.google.com/p/myspaceid-java-sdk/source/browse/#svn/trunk'>Java SDK source code directory</a></b>.

Samples in the SDK run out of the box, but for your own projects, you first need to register on the [MySpace Developer Site](http://developer.myspace.com/community/). Follow the instructions in this site to create an app; you'll get a consumer key and secret.

To develop with this SDK, please download the source code, read the documentation in the README file, and get the sample apps running.
